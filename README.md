A responsive educational website about the Solar System, built together with a friend. Deyan focused on the visual design and UI, while I implemented the technical side: layout, responsiveness, interactivity and localization. The site uses HTML, CSS and media queries to adapt the layout for desktop and mobile, ensuring the navigation, content sections and gallery work well on different screen sizes.

On the JavaScript side, I implemented a simple image gallery with previous/next controls that cycles through images and highlights the active one, as well as a client‑side language switcher between Bulgarian and English. The translation system is based on a translations object and data-translate attributes, dynamically updating text, buttons, links and embedded YouTube videos, while also remembering the user’s preferred language via localStorage. Overall, the project combines responsive design, basic DOM manipulation and internationalization to present structured information, media and quizzes about the Sun, planets and dwarf planets in an accessible way.​
